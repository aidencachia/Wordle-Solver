# Wordle Solver 

The following is a java program which is used in order to assist in the solving of word game *Wordle*. The CLI program uses a list of the words which could be inputted in the game and recommends the best word in order to cancel out as many other words as possible.

In order to run the program, use the main method within the Wordle.java in order to run the program. For Grey Letters, just write the letters next to each other (E.g. "trsp"). For the Orange and Green, continue to input the characters 1 by 1 until all of them are inputted, and input "0" when finished.

The WordleSimulator.java is still works in progress as it seems like the garbage collect of java is automatically removing the word list and interfering with the program.
